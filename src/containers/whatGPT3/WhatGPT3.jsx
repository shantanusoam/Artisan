        title="What is ArtisanDAO"
        text="ArtisanDAO is a Web3 marketplace made exclusively for indigenous artists to promote and sell their art in the form of NFTs
        Every NFT will come with a curated documentation of the artist, their art heritage, their contact details through which patrons can get in touch with the artist
        The web3 native community formed around the DAO will get  exlcusive benefits from owning the NFTs leading to them becoming evangelist and marketers for the indigenous artisans, promoting their century-old art form across the world.
        Being a patron at ArtisanDAO and owning a ArtisanDAO marketplace NFT will add social capital to the work of local artisans
        .Once the protocol is active in one country, it can be easily replicated across other countries as the DAO is an opensource protocol, with permissionless governance built-in.
